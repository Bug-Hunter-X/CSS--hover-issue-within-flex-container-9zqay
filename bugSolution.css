The issue stems from potential pointer-events interference or z-index conflicts within the flex container. The solution involves ensuring proper event propagation and potentially adjusting z-index values to prioritize the hover effect on the intended elements.

Here's a potential solution (bugSolution.css):

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  /* Ensure pointer events are not blocking hover */
  pointer-events: none; /*this could be an issue to other part of the system. use it only if it solves your problem*/
}

.container > .box {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  pointer-events: auto; /* This is essential to make hover work correctly */
}

.container > .box:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

This solution ensures that the hover events are correctly handled by the `.box` elements, even within the flex container. It is crucial to test this solution in your specific context to confirm its effectiveness.
